# Penetration_Testing
This repository contains all my endeavors and attempts at penetration testing through the assignments given at my university course.

Penetration Testing was done on Oracle Virtual Machines with Kali Linux as my machine. Target machines were: Jangow, Windows 10 and Kiopitrix.
Different penetration tasks were done with different levels of exploitation accross different platforms.

- Assignment 1 required for me to gather information on a certain domain (reconnaissance phase)
- Assignment 2 involved finding the user name and password of a user to be able to log in on the machine (jangow) 
- Assignment 3 involved implementing exploits on Window 10 machine both manually (finding an exploit of github or the like) and automatically (using metasploit)
